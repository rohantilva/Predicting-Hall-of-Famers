# Predicting-Hall-of-Famers
Using ML algorithms to predict Hall of Famers from both physical and skill-based attributes.

See poster for thorough explanation of project. To complete this project, we used:
  - Jupyter Notebooks
  - Python packages: NumPy, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib
  - Various Machine Learning/Classification algorithms such as:
    - Logistic Regression
    - K neighbors algorithm
    - LDA
    - Naive Bayes
